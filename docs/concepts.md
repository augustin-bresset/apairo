# Concepts

## Synchronous vs asynchronous

apairo distinguishes two fundamental ways that sensor data is organised on disk.

### Synchronous

In synchronous datasets, all modalities at frame `i` were captured at the same instant. Semantic segmentation datasets (SemanticKITTI, GOOSE, Rellis-3D) follow this layout: for every scan there is exactly one `.bin` point cloud file and one `.label` annotation file.

```
sequences/
  00/
    velodyne/  000000.bin  000001.bin  ...
    labels/    000000.label 000001.label ...
```

`ds[i]` returns a `Sample` with `timestamp=None` and a `data` dict containing all requested keys. Random access and standard PyTorch `DataLoader` shuffling work out of the box.

### Asynchronous

In asynchronous (KITTI-layout) datasets, each sensor has its own subdirectory with its own file sequence and a `timestamps.txt`. The sensors fire at different rates.

```
velodyne_0/   000000.bin   000001.bin   ...   timestamps.txt
image_left/   000000.png   000001.png   ...   timestamps.txt
imu/          000000.pt    000001.pt    ...   timestamps.txt
```

apairo merges all channels into a single timestamp-ordered timeline. `ds[i]` returns one event -- the scan or image or IMU reading at position `i` in the global timeline -- with its `timestamp` field set. Exactly one key is populated in `sample.data` per event.

## ProfiledDataset and YAML profiles

All synchronous dataset classes in apairo are backed by a YAML *structural profile* that describes the folder layout and data types. The profile replaces what would otherwise be boilerplate Python code in every dataset subclass.

A 2-line Python class:

```python
class Goose3DDataset(ProfiledDataset):
    _profile = "goose.yaml"
```

…combined with a YAML profile handles discovery, loading, splitting, and type casting automatically. See [YAML Profiles](datasets/yaml-profiles.md) for the full specification.

## The `.apairo` sidecar

When you run a preprocessing pipeline on a dataset, the output files are written alongside the original data and their location is recorded in a `.apairo` YAML sidecar file at the dataset root (or sequence directory).

```yaml
# .apairo
version: 1
channels:
  trav_label:
    kind: preprocess
    loader: npys
    has_timestamps: false
    sources: [labels]
```

On the next load, apairo reads `.apairo` to discover where derived keys live and which loader to use -- no code change needed:

```python
ds = Goose3DDataset("/data/goose", keys=["lidar", "trav_label"])
```

The sidecar is created and updated automatically by `run_preprocess`. You can also write it manually for ad-hoc derived data.

---

## Key resolution order

When you request `keys=["lidar", "trav_label"]`:

1. `lidar` is found in the YAML profile -> loaded via the binary path
2. `trav_label` is not in the profile -> looked up in `.apairo` -> loaded via `DERIVED_LOADERS`

At least one native key (declared in the profile) must be present alongside any derived keys -- the native files provide the file-count reference and the derived path template.
