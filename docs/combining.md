# Combining Datasets

## ConcatDataset

`ConcatDataset` concatenates multiple dataset instances into one. It intersects the available keys across all datasets, so every index always returns the same set of modalities.

```python
import apairo

sequences = [
    apairo.SemanticKittiDataset(f"/data/kitti/seq_{i:02d}", keys=["lidar", "labels"])
    for i in range(11)
]

combined = apairo.ConcatDataset(sequences)
print(len(combined))        # sum of all sequence lengths
sample = combined[0]        # first frame from the first sequence
```

Indexing is O(log n) via binary search over cumulative lengths.

## Sequence-level splits

`split_sequences` partitions a list of dataset objects at the **sequence level**, avoiding temporal leakage between train and validation sets.

```python
train, val, test = apairo.split_sequences(sequences, ratios=(0.8, 0.1, 0.1))

train_ds = apairo.ConcatDataset(train)
val_ds   = apairo.ConcatDataset(val)
test_ds  = apairo.ConcatDataset(test)
```

The split is positional (first 80% of sequences → train, etc.) rather than random, which preserves temporal structure within each split.

!!! warning "Use sequence-level splits, not frame-level"
    Frame-level random splits on time-series data leak future context into validation. Always split at the sequence boundary.

## PyTorch DataLoader

### Synchronous datasets

`ConcatDataset` implements `__getitem__` and `__len__`, which is all PyTorch's `DataLoader` needs for map-style loading. No wrapper class required:

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

train_loader = DataLoader(
    apairo.ConcatDataset(train),
    batch_size=8,
    shuffle=True,
    num_workers=4,
)

for batch in train_loader:
    lidar  = batch["lidar"]    # (8, N, 4)
    labels = batch["labels"]   # (8, N)
```

!!! note "Batching point clouds"
    Point clouds have variable numbers of points per frame. Use a custom `collate_fn` to handle variable-length tensors, or pre-process scans to a fixed size in your preprocessor.

### Asynchronous datasets

`DataLoader` checks `isinstance(dataset, IterableDataset)` to decide between map-style and iterable-style loading. For async datasets, inherit from `IterableDataset` to avoid `DataLoader` attempting random access:

```python
from torch.utils.data import IterableDataset, DataLoader

class MyTartanDataset(apairo.TartanKittiDataset, IterableDataset):
    pass

ds = MyTartanDataset("/data/tartan/seq", keys=["velodyne_0"])
loader = DataLoader(ds, batch_size=1, num_workers=0)
```

The one-line subclass is intentional — you own this integration point and can add custom `collate_fn`, worker init, or sampling logic without touching the library.

## Mixing datasets

You can concatenate datasets of different types as long as they share at least one key. The intersection is taken automatically:

```python
kitti_seqs = [apairo.SemanticKittiDataset(p, keys=["lidar", "labels"]) for p in kitti_paths]
goose_seqs = [apairo.Goose3DDataset(p, keys=["lidar", "labels"]) for p in goose_paths]

combined = apairo.ConcatDataset(kitti_seqs + goose_seqs)
# keys = {"lidar", "labels"}  — intersection, both share these
```
