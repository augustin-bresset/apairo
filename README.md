# Data Apairo

## Current development status

The project is currently in development and is not yet ready for use.
The `trainers` and `exemple`(oups french term) folders are not functional yet.


## Overview

Data Apairo is a project designed to manage datasets for machine learning and data analysis from robotics experiments.
It provides tools for loading, processing, and splitting datasets, as well as utilities for configuration and logging.

It is presented as an **extensive framework** for managing datasets in robotics, with a focus on time-series data.
`Datasets` used in robotics are generally time-series data, in which the data is asynchronous and pseudo-periodic.
This results in challenges such as the synchronization of the data during sampling, the management of time, and the management of the data itself to avoid RAM overflow, for example.

It is built to be easily extensible and customizable, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
For example, some `Sampler` are already implemented but because they are model-dependent, it is highly recommended to implement your own.

Finally, we invite the user to use the existing `Objects` or create their own to manage the data in the way they want.

The user can add their own `Dataset` by implementing a subclass of `AbstractDataset` that will interpret the data in the way they want.

Then manage their pipeline with `Torch` functionalities and `Sampler` to manage the data in the way they want.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://gitlab.ensta.fr/bresset/apero
    cd APAIRO
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    # Optional: Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install the required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

#### Dataset

Different datasets are available in the `src/dataset` directory.
For the example, we will use the `TartanKittiDataset` dataset.

All of the datasets contain a `__getitem__` method that returns a dictionary with the data.
The index is sorted by time, so the data is returned in the order it was recorded.

We consider that our data directory is structured as follows:

```
data/tartan_kitti_1/
    images/
        000000.png
        000001.png
        ...
        timestamps.txt
    poses/
        poses.npy
        timestamps.txt
    height_map/
        000000.npy
        000001.npy
        ...
        timestamps.txt
```

```python
from src.dataset import TartanKittiDataset

# Create the dataset
dataset = TartanKittiDataset(
    data_dir="data/tartan_kitti_1",
    keys=["images", "poses", "height_map"],
)
```

Creating the dataset will perform pre-processing on the data, such as loading some data to check the dimensions and the timestamps.
By doing this, it will recreate the timeline of the data.
This is an internal feature that is used to ensure that the data is in the correct order. It is presented here to show how the data is managed.

```python
for (key, idx) in dataset.timeline:
    print(key, idx)
>>> images 0
>>> poses 0
>>> poses 1
>>> height_map 0
...
```
The `timeline`attribute may need to be processed during the initialization for some datasets.


That is how in the `TorchTKDataset` during preprocessing creates the timeline of the data.

Then you can access the data by using the `__getitem__` method:

```python
# Get some data
from src.dataset import TorchTKDataset
dataset = TorchTKDataset(
    data_dir="data/tartan_kitti_1",
    keys=["images", "poses", "height_map"],
)

dataset[0]
>>> {"key": "images", "data": ..., "timestamp": ...}

dataset[1]
>>> {"key": "poses", "data": ..., "timestamp": ...}

dataset[2]
>>> {"key": "poses", "data": ..., "timestamp": ...}

dataset[3]
>>> {"key": "height_map","data": ..., "timestamp": ...}
```

#### Sampler

The `Sampler` is used to sample the data in the dataset. It means reuniting the data in the way you want to train your model.
The `Sampler` is independent of the dataset and can be used with any dataset.
Furthermore, the `Sampler` has to respect the timeline of the data.
Some `Sampler` are already implemented in the `src/sampler` directory with simple functionalities.
Such as :
* LatestSyncSampler : Return the latest synchronized data.
* LowFrequencySampler : Return the data sampled by stacking the data with their lower frequency.

Those examples may not be enough for your model, so you can implement your own `Sampler` class.



#### Trainer

In the `trainers` directory, you will put your training scripts.
Then execute the following command to run the training:

```sh
python3 -m trainers.my_trainer
```

### Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory. You can customize the training and dataset parameters by editing the YAML files.

### Test

To run the tests, use the following command in the root directory:

```sh
python3 -m unittest
```

## Data

As mentioned before, the data is generally time-series data, meaning that the data is asynchronous and the time is not fixed (aperiodic).
This brings some challenges to ensure that the user has control over the data and the time.

### Dataset

To ensure the data remains in the same conditions as reality, the `Dataset` class is designed to keep the data in the same order as it was recorded.

So in its `Mapping` and `Iterable` form, `__getitem__` and `__iter__` will return the data in **time order**.

### Sampler

The sampler, such as the one in PyTorch, is used to sample the data by managing the indexes to avoid mismanagement of the data.

But we take our situation into account, the data is time-dependent, so the `Sampler` works on the timeline to return the associated indexes. In this way, a sampler is independent of the dataset and can be used with any dataset.


## Organization

...

### Architecture

The project is organized as follows:

- `trainers/`: Contains the training scripts.
    Those scripts are used to train the models on the datasets.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the project.
      - `core/`: Contains the core classes of the project. (Mostly abstract classes)
      - `dataset/`: Contains the dataset classes.
      - `loader/`: Contains the loader classes.
      - `sampler/`: Contains the sampler classes.
      - `utils/`: Contains utility functions and classes.
- `config/`: Contains the configuration files. (Not sure to keep it)
- `test/`: Contains the test files.

### Design

The idea is that the user will code their own `Trainer` script in the `trainers/` folder.
If a tool is missing, the user can implement it in the `src/` folder except for the `core` folder which contains the abstract classes.

This way we present already implemented tools that permit the user to start quickly creating their own model. And if it is not enough the user can:

- change the data they are using, they can implement their own `Dataset` class with appropriate `Loader`.
- change the way the data is sampled, they can implement their own `Sampler` class.

And in future versions:

- Use and create transformation `Node` in the same philosophy as [kedro](https://kedro.org/).

### Notes

In a future version, the unit tests folder will be in the `src/` folder to test the classes.
