    r"""An interface class representing a :class:`Loader`. 
    
    All subclasses should overwrite :meth:`__getitem__` supporting fetching a
    data sample for a given key. Subclasses could also optionally overwrite
    :meth:`__len__`, which is expected to return the size of the data and :meth:`shape` 
    which is expected to return the shape of the data (dimension).
    
    For example a set of ten images of size 3x224x224 would have a len of 10 and a shape of (3, 224, 224).
